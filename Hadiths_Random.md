Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr (May 624 – 692 CE) was a prominent Sahabi and leader who opposed the Umayyad caliphate, establishing his own caliphate in Mecca from 683 until his death. He was the first child born to the Muhajirun (early Muslim emigrants) in Medina, grandson of Abu Bakr, and known for his piety and political leadership during the Second Fitna. Refusing to pledge allegiance to Yazid ibn Mu'awiya, he resisted Umayyad rule, which culminated in a siege of Mecca led by Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf under Caliph Abd al-Malik. Ibn al-Zubayr was killed in the 692 siege, and his death marked the end of his rival caliphate. His legacy includes his efforts to restore the political and religious significance of the Hejaz region and his close association with Mecca.

Here is an authentic article-style presentation regarding Abdullah ibn Masood (RA) and the Quran, including his method of recitation and his teachings, with verified Hadith translations and references without modification:

***

## Abdullah ibn Masood (RA) and the Quran: Teachings and Recitation in Light of Authentic Hadith

Abdullah ibn Masood (RA) was one of the foremost companions of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ endowed with profound knowledge and a beautiful recitation of the Quran. He was renowned for his direct learning from the Prophet ﷺ and became one of the primary sources of Quranic knowledge for the early Muslim community. The Prophet ﷺ himself recommended learning the Quran from him due to his mastery in recitation and understanding.

### 1. The Prophet ﷺ Asked Ibn Masood to Recite the Quran to Him

The Prophet ﷺ said to Abdullah ibn Masood:

> *"Recite the Quran to me."*  
> Abdullah ibn Masood replied, *"Shall I recite (it) to you while it has been revealed to you?"*  
> The Prophet ﷺ said, *"I like to hear it from another person."*  
> So Ibn Masood recited Surat An-Nisa (The Women) until he reached the verse: *"How (will it be) then when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people."* (4:41)  
> Then the Prophet ﷺ said, *"Enough for the present,"* and his eyes overflowed with tears.  
> (Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 4999) [citation_id 1][citation_id 2]

### 2. Ibn Masood's Quranic Knowledge and Mastery

Ibn Masood was recognized for knowing the circumstances of revelation and the correct application of the recited verses. He said:

> *"By Allah other than Whom none has the right to be worshipped! There is no Sura revealed in Allah's Book but I know at what place it was revealed; and there is no Verse revealed in Allah's Book but I know about whom it was revealed..."*  
> (Sahih al-Bukhari) [citation_id 2]

His knowledge extended to precise understanding of the context, place, and audience of the Quranic verses.

### 3. The Prophet ﷺ Told Others to Learn the Quran from Ibn Masood

The Prophet ﷺ advised others to learn the Quran from him, emphasizing his authenticity and expertise:

> *"Learn the recitation of Quran from four: from Abdullah ibn Masood (first), Salim, the freed slave of Abu Hudhaifa, Muadh ibn Jabal, and Ubai ibn Ka'b."*  
> (Sahih al-Bukhari) [citation_id 6]  

This highlights Ibn Masood’s esteemed position as one of the foremost teachers of the Quran in the early Islamic period.

### 4. Preservation of the Quran's Authentic Recitation

Ibn Masood was strict about preserving the Quran’s correct recitation and teaching only what was revealed directly by the Prophet ﷺ. For example, he confronted a person reciting a Surah in a way different from his teaching:

> Ibn Masood said to a man, *"Who taught you this Surah which I have heard you reciting?"* The man replied, *"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) taught it to me."* Ibn Masood responded, *"You are telling a lie; By Allah! Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) taught me (in a different way) this very Surah which I have heard you reciting."* He then took him to the Prophet ﷺ, who confirmed both recitations were revealed.  
> The Prophet ﷺ said: *"The Quran has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite of it whichever (way) is easier for you."*  
> (Sahih al-Bukhari) [citation_id 2][citation_id 3]

This establishes the permissibility of several authentic Qira'at (modes of Quranic recitation).

### 5. Emphasis on Tajweed and Correct Pronunciation

The Prophet ﷺ demonstrated and taught tajweed (correct pronunciation and melodious tone) to his companions, including Ibn Masood, who carefully maintained these aspects in his recitation and teaching.

Anas ibn Malik reported about the Prophet's recitation:

> *"He used to pray long (certain sounds) very much."* (Prolongation of pronunciation)  
> (Sahih al-Bukhari) [citation_id 2]

The Prophet ﷺ’s practice was to recite with beautification and proper articulation, which Ibn Masood preserved and transmitted.

### 6. The Prophet ﷺ’s Emotional Connection to Ibn Masood’s Recitation

It is reported that when Ibn Masood recited Surah An-Nisa in the presence of the Prophet ﷺ, the Prophet was moved to tears, showing the profound spiritual impact of his recitation.

> *"I recited Surat An-Nisa... The Prophet ﷺ said, 'Enough for the present,' and his eyes overflowed with tears."*  
> (Sahih al-Bukhari) [citation_id 1]

### Summary

- Abdullah ibn Masood (RA) was a leading companion renowned for Quranic knowledge and recitation.
- The Prophet ﷺ personally instructed others to learn the Quran from him.
- Ibn Masood mastered the correct recitation, tajweed, and knowledge of contexts of revelations.
- The Quran was revealed to be recited in multiple authentic ways; Ibn Masood was an authority in one of them.
- The Prophet ﷺ expressed emotional reverence for Ibn Masood’s recitation.
- Preservation of the Quran in its pure form was central to Ibn Masood’s teachings.

https://youtu.be/a0nYlGp4v1M?list=PLfp2JeoDQyGPLP0yPqC_klq03JuvBlEQp&t=683



**Bayat ul Ridwan**, also known as the "Pledge of Ridwan" or "**Pledge of the Tree**," is a historic and significant event in early Islamic history where the companions (Sahaba) of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) swore allegiance to him under a tree near Mecca before the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in the year 628 CE (6 AH).

### What Happened in Bayat ul Ridwan:
- When the Prophet sent Uthman ibn Affan as an emissary to Mecca to negotiate with the Quraysh, the Quraysh detained Uthman.
- Hearing about this, the Prophet feared that hostility might break out, so he gathered his companions near Mecca and sought their pledge to remain steadfast, support him, and be ready to fight to defend the cause, even to the point of death.
- The companions placed their hands in the hand of the Prophet, swearing this solemn oath of allegiance.
- Just as they pledged, Uthman returned safely, and battle was averted, but the pledge demonstrated their commitment.
- Allah revealed the verse commemorating this event:  
  **"Certainly Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you, [O Muhammad], under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquillity upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest."** (Qur'an, Surah Al-Fath 48:18)

### Meaning of Bayat ul Ridwan:
- It is a pledge or oath of allegiance (bay'ah) demonstrating total loyalty, readiness to sacrifice, and firm belief.
- The name "Ridwan" means "satisfaction" or "pleasure," indicating Allah’s pleasure with those who took this pledge.
- This pledge is symbolic of unwavering faith and unity of the early Muslim community in the face of adversity.

### Key Points:
- It is one of the rare instances mentioned explicitly in the Qur'an for which Allah’s pleasure was declared on His believers.
- Also known as the "Pledge of the Tree" because it took place under a tree near Hudaybiyyah.
- It emphasizes the importance of solidarity and commitment to leadership and faith.

### Authentic Sources and Further Reading:
- Quranic verse Surah Al-Fath (48:18): [Islamicstudies.info link](https://islamicstudies.info/reference.php?sura=48&verse=18)

- Video explaining the Bayat al-Ridwan event: [YouTube explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEz8GWPXWwU)

In summary, Bayat ul Ridwan is a landmark moment showcasing the sincere commitment of the Prophet’s companions, earning Allah’s pleasure as explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an.

#### Do not Share _Bad Dreams_.

Islam provides clear guidance regarding the etiquette of sharing dreams, especially bad dreams. The authentic proof is the sayings (hadith) of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him):

- The Prophet said: **“If one of you sees a dream that he dislikes, let him spit drily to his left three times and seek refuge with Allah from the Shaitan three times, and not mention it to anyone, and it will not harm him.”** (Sahih Muslim 2262, also found in Sahih Bukhari 7045).[2][3][7]
- Another narration: **“If anyone of you saw a dream which he disliked, then that is from Satan and he should seek refuge with Allah from it and should not tell it to anybody for it will not harm him.”** (Sahih Bukhari).[7]
- The Prophet rebuked those who narrated dreams that were from the Shaitan, saying, **"Do not tell anyone how the Shaitan is messing about with you in your dreams."** (Sahih Muslim 2268).[2]

The wisdom, as explained by scholars, is to prevent distress, misguidance, or harm, as bad dreams can cause unnecessary worry and are not meaningful to others. Following the Prophet’s guidance ensures peace of mind and safety from bad effects.[5][8]
