Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr (May 624 – 692 CE) was a prominent Sahabi and leader who opposed the Umayyad caliphate, establishing his own caliphate in Mecca from 683 until his death. He was the first child born to the Muhajirun (early Muslim emigrants) in Medina, grandson of Abu Bakr, and known for his piety and political leadership during the Second Fitna. Refusing to pledge allegiance to Yazid ibn Mu'awiya, he resisted Umayyad rule, which culminated in a siege of Mecca led by Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf under Caliph Abd al-Malik. Ibn al-Zubayr was killed in the 692 siege, and his death marked the end of his rival caliphate. His legacy includes his efforts to restore the political and religious significance of the Hejaz region and his close association with Mecca.

Here is an authentic article-style presentation regarding Abdullah ibn Masood (RA) and the Quran, including his method of recitation and his teachings, with verified Hadith translations and references without modification:

## Abdullah ibn Masood (RA) and the Quran: Teachings and Recitation in Light of Authentic Hadith

Abdullah ibn Masood (RA) was one of the foremost companions of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ endowed with profound knowledge and a beautiful recitation of the Quran. He was renowned for his direct learning from the Prophet ﷺ and became one of the primary sources of Quranic knowledge for the early Muslim community. The Prophet ﷺ himself recommended learning the Quran from him due to his mastery in recitation and understanding.

### 1. The Prophet ﷺ Asked Ibn Masood to Recite the Quran to Him

The Prophet ﷺ said to Abdullah ibn Masood:

> *"Recite the Quran to me."*  
> Abdullah ibn Masood replied, *"Shall I recite (it) to you while it has been revealed to you?"*  
> The Prophet ﷺ said, *"I like to hear it from another person."*  
> So Ibn Masood recited Surat An-Nisa (The Women) until he reached the verse: *"How (will it be) then when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people."* (4:41)  
> Then the Prophet ﷺ said, *"Enough for the present,"* and his eyes overflowed with tears.  
> (Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 4999) [citation_id 1][citation_id 2]

### 2. Ibn Masood's Quranic Knowledge and Mastery

Ibn Masood was recognized for knowing the circumstances of revelation and the correct application of the recited verses. He said:

> *"By Allah other than Whom none has the right to be worshipped! There is no Sura revealed in Allah's Book but I know at what place it was revealed; and there is no Verse revealed in Allah's Book but I know about whom it was revealed..."*  
> (Sahih al-Bukhari) [citation_id 2]

His knowledge extended to precise understanding of the context, place, and audience of the Quranic verses.

### 3. The Prophet ﷺ Told Others to Learn the Quran from Ibn Masood

The Prophet ﷺ advised others to learn the Quran from him, emphasizing his authenticity and expertise:

> *"Learn the recitation of Quran from four: from Abdullah ibn Masood (first), Salim, the freed slave of Abu Hudhaifa, Muadh ibn Jabal, and Ubai ibn Ka'b."*  
> (Sahih al-Bukhari) [citation_id 6]  

This highlights Ibn Masood’s esteemed position as one of the foremost teachers of the Quran in the early Islamic period.

### 4. Preservation of the Quran's Authentic Recitation

Ibn Masood was strict about preserving the Quran’s correct recitation and teaching only what was revealed directly by the Prophet ﷺ. For example, he confronted a person reciting a Surah in a way different from his teaching:

> Ibn Masood said to a man, *"Who taught you this Surah which I have heard you reciting?"* The man replied, *"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) taught it to me."* Ibn Masood responded, *"You are telling a lie; By Allah! Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) taught me (in a different way) this very Surah which I have heard you reciting."* He then took him to the Prophet ﷺ, who confirmed both recitations were revealed.  
> The Prophet ﷺ said: *"The Quran has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite of it whichever (way) is easier for you."*  
> (Sahih al-Bukhari) [citation_id 2][citation_id 3]

This establishes the permissibility of several authentic Qira'at (modes of Quranic recitation).

### 5. Emphasis on Tajweed and Correct Pronunciation

The Prophet ﷺ demonstrated and taught tajweed (correct pronunciation and melodious tone) to his companions, including Ibn Masood, who carefully maintained these aspects in his recitation and teaching.

Anas ibn Malik reported about the Prophet's recitation:

> *"He used to pray long (certain sounds) very much."* (Prolongation of pronunciation)  
> (Sahih al-Bukhari) [citation_id 2]

The Prophet ﷺ’s practice was to recite with beautification and proper articulation, which Ibn Masood preserved and transmitted.

### 6. The Prophet ﷺ’s Emotional Connection to Ibn Masood’s Recitation

It is reported that when Ibn Masood recited Surah An-Nisa in the presence of the Prophet ﷺ, the Prophet was moved to tears, showing the profound spiritual impact of his recitation.

> *"I recited Surat An-Nisa... The Prophet ﷺ said, 'Enough for the present,' and his eyes overflowed with tears."*  
> (Sahih al-Bukhari) [citation_id 1]

### Summary

- Abdullah ibn Masood (RA) was a leading companion renowned for Quranic knowledge and recitation.
- The Prophet ﷺ personally instructed others to learn the Quran from him.
- Ibn Masood mastered the correct recitation, tajweed, and knowledge of contexts of revelations.
- The Quran was revealed to be recited in multiple authentic ways; Ibn Masood was an authority in one of them.
- The Prophet ﷺ expressed emotional reverence for Ibn Masood’s recitation.
- Preservation of the Quran in its pure form was central to Ibn Masood’s teachings.
