Yes, both **إنَّهُ** (innahu) and **هَذَا** (hādhā) can be used to convey the idea of "it is," but they are used in different contexts and have distinct meanings.

### 1. **إنَّهُ** (innahu)
- **Meaning**: "Indeed, it is" or "It is."
- **Usage**: 
  - **Emphasis**: It is often used to emphasize a statement or assertion.

### 2. **هَذَا** (hādhā)
- **Meaning**: "This."
- **Usage**:

  - In some contexts, you might use **إنَّهُ** to emphasize a statement about something that has already been mentioned, while **هَذَا** can be used to introduce or identify that same thing.
  - For example, if you are discussing a book and want to emphasize its quality, you might say:
  
    - **إنَّهُ كِتَابٌ جَمِيلٌ** (innahu kitābun jamīlٌ) - "Indeed, it is a nice book."
  - If you are showing the book to someone, you would say:
    - **هَذَا كِتَابٌ جَمِيلٌ** (hādhā kitābun jamīlٌ) - "This is a nice book."
