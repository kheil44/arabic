**Tahiyyatul Wudu’**

Riyad Us-Saliheen (Gardens of the Righteous)

Chapter 209
The Excellence of Performing two Rak'ah of Voluntary Prayer after Ablution

1146. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said to Bilal (May Allah be pleased with him) "Tell me about the most hopeful act (i.e., one which you deem the most rewarding with Allah) you have done since your acceptance of Islam because I heard the sound of the steps of your shoes in front of me in Jannah.'' Bilal said: "I do not consider any act more hopeful than that whenever I make Wudu' (or took a bath) in an hour of night or day, I would immediately perform Salat (prayer) for as long as was destined for me to perform.''
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

Commentary: The word "Tuhur'' is used for "Wudu", Ghusl and Tayammum because one gets the ritual purity by all these means and then one can perform Salat freely. It means that everytime during the day or night Bilal made Wudu'' or Ghusl, he would invariably perform some Nafl prayer. Some of the Ahadith explicitly say two Rak`ah. This act of his so much pleased Allah that he was blessed with the distinction which was witnessed by the Prophet (PBUH) himself. This Hadith proves the merit of performing two Rak`ah prayer after ablution. Some `Ulama' hold that this two Rak`ah prayer as well as Tahiyyat-ul-Masjid  are permissible even in hours when Salat is Makruh (undesirable), while others stick to the injunctions which regard Nafl Salat after Fajr and `Asr prayer undesirable.

## The Two Rak‘ah Prayer After Wudu:  
### Qur’anic Practice, Hadith Proofs, Rewards, and Details

Praying two rak‘ahs (units) after performing wudu is a well-established, highly-rewarded Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, with strong proofs in both **Sahih al-Bukhari** and **Sahih Muslim**.

### 1️⃣ **Direct Proof from Sahih al-Bukhari**

**Narrated by Humran (the freed slave of ‘Uthman):**

> “‘Uthman bin ‘Affan called for water to perform wudu. He washed his hands three times... (full description of wudu follows) ... Then ‘Uthman said:  
> I saw Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) perform ablution like this and the Prophet said:
>
> **“Whoever performs ablution like this wudu of mine, and prays two rak‘at without letting his mind wander in them, all his previous sins will be forgiven.”**
>
> — [Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 4 (Wudu’), Hadith 159-164; see [bukhari:164 on Sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:164)]  
> — Also referenced in [IslamQA](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45730), [QuestionsOnIslam](https://questionsonislam.com/question/there-hadith-about-offering-two-rakah-prayer-after-making-wudu-ablution)[5]

### 2️⃣ **Direct Proof from Sahih Muslim**

**Narrated by ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir:**

> “No Muslim performs ablution and performs it well, then stands and prays two rak‘ahs, turning his face and heart (towards Allah), without Paradise being guaranteed for him.”
>
> — [Sahih Muslim, Book 2 (Purification), Hadith 234a; see [muslim:234a on Sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com/muslim:234a)]  
> — [IslamBasics](https://islambasics.com/chapter/the-excellence-of-performing-two-rakah-of-voluntary-prayer-after-ablution/)[1], [Fiqh Islam Online](https://fiqh.islamonline.net/en/virtues-of-praying-two-rakahs-after-wudu/)[6]

Another narration in Muslim from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه):

> “There is no one among you who performs wudu and does it well, then says:  
> *Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ʿabduhu wa rasuluhu*  
> (I bear witness that there is no god except Allah alone with no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger)  
> — but the eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him, and he may enter through whichever one he wishes.”
>
> — [Sahih Muslim 234](https://sunnah.com/muslim:234a)[3]

### 3️⃣ **The Story of Bilal (Bukhari & Muslim)**

**Narrated Abu Hurairah:**

> The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Bilal (رضي الله عنه):  
> **“Tell me about the most hopeful act (i.e., one which you deem the most rewarding with Allah) you have done since your acceptance of Islam, because I heard the sound of your footsteps in front of me in Jannah.”**  
> Bilal said:  
> “I do not consider any act more hopeful than that whenever I make wudu (at any hour of night or day), I would immediately perform prayer as much as I was destined to perform.”
>
> — [Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 21, Hadith 1146 & 1149](https://islambasics.com/chapter/the-excellence-of-performing-two-rakah-of-voluntary-prayer-after-ablution/)[1]  
> — [Muslim; see Fiqh Islam Online](https://fiqh.islamonline.net/en/virtues-of-praying-two-rakahs-after-wudu/)[6]

https://islamqa.info/en/answers/330743/the-difference-between-mercy-that-is-created-and-mercy-that-is-a-divine-attribute

...........
...........
...........

The mercy of Allah is of two types:

The first type is an attribute of the Essence of Allah, may He be exalted. This is not created and it is infinite, for He is the Most Gracious (ar-Rahman), the Most Merciful (ar-Rahim). {And your Lord is the Forgiving, full of mercy} [al-Kahf 18:58].

The second type is created mercy, which is composed of one hundred parts of which Allah sent down one in this world, and He has kept the other ninety-nine parts by which He will show mercy to His slaves on the Day of Resurrection.

Al-Bukhari (6469) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Indeed Allah created mercy, on the day He created it, in one hundred parts. Then He kept ninety-nine parts of it with Him and sent one part for all of His creation. If the disbeliever knew of all that there is with Allah of mercy, he would never despair of Paradise, and if the believer knew of all that there is with Allah of punishment, he would never feel safe from the Fire.”

Muslim (2725) narrated it as follows: “Indeed, Allah has one hundred parts of mercy, of which He sent one part to be shared between the jinn, humankind, the animals and the vermin. By virtue of it they show compassion to one another and show mercy to one another, and by virtue of it the wild animal shows compassion to its offspring. And Allah has kept behind ninety-nine parts of mercy, by which He will show mercy to His slaves on the Day of Resurrection.”

Here is the **full story**, Arabic duʿāʾ, English translation, and **all major references** regarding the incident involving **Ammar ibn Yasir** and the "short" prayer:

## **THE FULL INCIDENT**


## **MAJOR REFERENCES**

1. **Sunan an-Nasā’ī #1305**  
 https://sunnah.com/nasai:1305  
 Ata ibn As-Sa'ib narrated that his father said:  
 "Ammar led us in prayer and made it brief. Some said: 'You made it brief.' He said: 'Nevertheless, I recited supplications I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' …"

2. **Sunan an-Nasā’ī #1306**  
 https://sunnah.com/nasai:1306  
 https://amrayn.com/nasai:1306  
 Summary: "'Ammar bin Yasir led the people in prayer and he made the prayer short. It was as if they disliked that, so he said: 'Did I not do bowing and prostration properly?' They said: 'Yes.' He said: 'And I said a supplication that the Prophet ﷺ used to say...'"

3. **Other sources reiterating this narration**:

## **NOTES**

- **Hadith Grade:** "Hasan" (reliable), as authenticated by hadith scholars[2].
- **Purpose:** ʿAmmār wasn't **rushing** out of carelessness; he ensured bowing and prostration were complete, and prioritized the deep duʿāʾ he learned from the Prophet ﷺ.
- **No mention** of Shaytān or “racing” as the reason in any authentic versions.

## **References**

- **“رَبَّنَا آتِنَا …”** is from **Qur’an 2:201**—the Prophet ﷺ often recited it in duʿā and it is permissible and recommended in prayer ([2][3]).
- **“رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لِي…”** is from **Qur’an 14:41**, and used by the Prophet and righteous before and beyond salāh—also valid inside prayer.

**It is permissible** to supplicate any authentic Qur’anic duʿā (including these two) after the final tashahhud and before salam, according to scholarly consensus[2][3][6][7].

## **In summary:**
- The duʿāʼ read just before salam in the linked video is  
  **رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً …**  
  and then  
  **رَبَّنَا اغْفِرْ لِي وَلِوَالِدَيَّ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ …**
- Both are from the Qur'an, authentically recited by the Prophet ﷺ, and are fully permitted as part of your prayer's final supplication[2][3].

> “O Allah, forgive me for what I have sent forth and what I have delayed,
for what I have kept hidden and what I have made public,
and for what I have done excessively,
and for what You know better than me.
You are the One Who brings forward and the One Who delays.
There is no god but You.”

✅ These six duʿās are the primary authentic ones found **after the tashahhud and before the taslīm**.

There are secondary duʿās (like the one based on Qur’an 2:201), and you may recite personal supplications here before taslīm — provided they:
- Are dignified
- Use Islamic phrasing
- Follow Arabic duʿā’ structure (if in Arabic)

Would you like me to:
- Format all of these into a **PDF-ready version**?
- Or continue with **post-salāh duʿā’, dhikr and tasbīḥ**?

Just say the word.
