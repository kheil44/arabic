### _Total Number of Authentic Hadith(meaning Sahih, Sahih li Ghayrihi, Hasan, Hasan  Ghayrihi) are 25,000 to 35,000.and they will be found in 6 books of Hadith, Bukhari etc_

---

The term **"Sahihain"** (ÿßŸÑÿµÿ≠Ÿäÿ≠ŸäŸÜ) refers to the two most authentic and authoritative collections of hadith in Sunni Islam: **Sahih al-Bukhari** and **Sahih Muslim**. These two books are highly respected and considered the most reliable sources of the sayings, actions, and approvals of Prophet Muhammad (Ô∑∫). Together, they form the core of authentic hadith literature in Islam.

- **Sahih al-Bukhari** was compiled by Imam Muhammad al-Bukhari and consists of hadiths that meet his strict criteria of authenticity.
- **Sahih Muslim** was compiled by Imam Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj and similarly includes hadiths that meet rigorous standards of reliability.

Because both collections only include *sahih* (authentic) hadith, they are often collectively called *Sahihain*, meaning "the two sahihs" or "the two authentic ones".[2][7]

These two collections contain thousands of hadiths that form the primary foundation for Islamic theology, law, and practice among Sunni Muslims.[1][3]

In summary, **Sahihain** means the combined pair of Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, regarded as the most authentic hadith compilations in Sunni Islam.

### Imam Bukhari and Muslim didnt recomend using weak hadith at all, Muslim said there so many Sahih Hadith............


## üìö Categories of Hadith

## the following order is not right compare to Aziz. its Sahih, Sahih li Ghayrihi, Hasan, Hasan and finally li Ghayrihi

In Islamic tradition, hadith (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) are classified into several categories based on their authenticity and reliability. Here are the seven main categories:

### 1. **Sahih (ÿµÿ≠Ÿäÿ≠)**
   - **Definition**: Authentic hadith that is well-established and reliable.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Continuous chain of trustworthy narrators.
     - Free from any hidden defects.
     - Conforms to the principles of Islamic teachings.

### 2. **Hasan (ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸÜ)**
   - **Definition**: Good hadith that is slightly less reliable than sahih but still acceptable.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Chain of narrators is reliable but may have minor issues.
     - Generally accepted for use in Islamic teachings.

### 3. **Sahih li Ghayrihi (ÿµÿ≠Ÿäÿ≠ ŸÑÿ∫Ÿäÿ±Ÿá)**
   - **Definition**: A hadith that is considered sahih due to supporting evidence from other sources.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Not originally sahih on its own but gains authenticity through corroborating hadith.

### 4. **Gharib (ÿ∫ÿ±Ÿäÿ®)**
   - **Definition**: A hadith that has a weak chain of narrators or is reported by a single narrator.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - May be accepted if it does not contradict stronger hadith.

### 5. **Da'if (ÿ∂ÿπŸäŸÅ)**
   - **Definition**: Weak hadith that lacks reliability.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Contains issues in the chain of narrators or the content itself.
     - Generally not used for establishing legal rulings.

### 6. **Da'if Jidan (ÿ∂ÿπŸäŸÅ ÿ¨ÿØÿßŸã)**
   - **Definition**: Very weak hadith with significant issues in its chain or content.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Not acceptable for use in any serious context.

### 7. **Mawdu' (ŸÖŸàÿ∂Ÿàÿπ)**
   - **Definition**: Fabricated hadith that is falsely attributed to the Prophet Muhammad.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Completely unreliable and rejected in Islamic teachings.

---

These categories help scholars and students of hadith determine the reliability and applicability of various narrations in Islamic jurisprudence and teachings. Understanding these classifications is essential for anyone studying hadith literature.







The five conditions that make a hadith **authentic (sahih)** are well-established in Islamic scholarship. Briefly, they are:

1. **Continuity of the Chain (Ittisaal as-Sanad):**  
   Each narrator in the chain must have directly heard or received the narration from the previous one, ensuring an unbroken, connected chain back to the Prophet Ô∑∫.
   =sahaba -> tabeen -> atba tabeen. [at leas one narrator from each generation to keep the chain connected. ]

3. **Integrity of the Narrators (‚ÄòAdaalah):**  
   Every narrator must be of upright character ‚Äî a truthful, practicing Muslim who avoids major sins and is trustworthy.
   => not known for openely commit sin, not known for commity any form of heresy. _marowa_ i guess, meaning kept conduct that was acceptable.
4. **Accuracy/Precision of Transmission (Dabt):**  
   Narrators must have strong memory and attention to detail, accurately preserving and conveying the hadith without errors or forgetfulness.
   => should be able to narrate the hadith Exactly as Heard.

6. **Freedom from Anomaly (Ghayr Shadh):**  
   The hadith must not contradict or conflict with other more reliable or well-known narrations; it should be consistent with established reports.
   The hadith must not contradict, Quran, another narrator.

8. **Absence of Hidden Defects (‚ÄòIllah Qadiha):**  
   The hadith must be free of hidden flaws or defects in the chain or text that might undermine its authenticity, even if not immediately obvious.

When a hadith meets all these five criteria, scholars classify it as **sahih (authentic)** and consider it reliable to source Islamic rulings and beliefs.[1][2][3][4][7]

## üåü Seven Types of People Who Will Be Shaded by Allah

In Islamic tradition, there are specific categories of individuals who will receive special shade from Allah on the Day of Judgment. This shade is a sign of Allah's mercy and protection. Here are the seven categories:

### 1. **A Just Ruler**
   - A leader who governs with fairness and justice, ensuring that their subjects are treated equitably.

### 2. **A Young Person Who Grows Up in Worship**
   - A person who dedicates their youth to the worship of Allah and follows His guidance throughout their life.

### 3. **A Person Whose Heart is Attached to the Mosque**
   - Someone who regularly attends the mosque for prayers and feels a deep connection to it, finding peace and solace in worship.

### 4. **Two People Who Love Each Other for the Sake of Allah**
   - Friends or companions who come together and maintain their relationship solely for the love of Allah, without any ulterior motives.

### 5. **A Person Who Gives Charity in Secret**
   - An individual who gives to those in need without seeking recognition or praise, ensuring their acts of charity remain private.

### 6. **A Person Who is Tempted by a Beautiful Woman but Resists**
   - Someone who is approached with temptation but chooses to remain steadfast and resist, fearing Allah.
 bu
### 7. **A Person Who Remembers Allah in Solitude**
   - An individual who engages in the remembrance of Allah when alone, feeling a deep connection and devotion in their private moments.
for example; Narrated by Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:
"The left hand does not know what the right hand has given in charity."

but some mention  that "...... the Left hand has given in charity." things like this make it Defective. not the whole hadith but this point can make it alright that you can give charit with Left hand....."



---

These categories highlight the importance of justice, worship, charity, and sincere relationships in Islam. Those who embody these qualities are promised special favor and protection from Allah on the Day of Judgment. If you have any further questions or need more details, feel free to ask!

Here is a clear rewrite of Imam al-Bukhari‚Äôs well-known conditions for accepting a hadith as authentic (·π£a·∏•ƒ´·∏•), now including authoritative sources and links for your reference:

### Imam al-Bukhari‚Äôs Conditions for an Authentic Hadith

1. **Continuity of the Chain (IttisƒÅl al-Sanad):**  
   Every narrator must have directly heard from or met the person they narrate from, ensuring an unbroken and connected chain all the way back to the Prophet Ô∑∫. Imam Bukhari was known for meticulously verifying that narrators had physically met to transmit the hadith directly.  
   [Source: Genius Journals - Imam Al-Bukhari and The Science of Hadith](https://geniusjournals.org/index.php/esh/article/download/1815/1620)

2. **Trustworthiness and Integrity of Narrators (‚ÄòAdƒÅlah):**  
   Every narrator must be an upright, truthful Muslim known for moral integrity and avoidance of major sins. If the narrator was found to have faults such as lying or major sins, Imam Bukhari would reject the hadith.  
   [Source: Tharwah Journal - Methodology Study Hadith by Imam Bukhari](https://journal.iainlhokseumawe.ac.id/index.php/tharwah/article/download/583/1032/9796)

3. **Accuracy and Precision (·∏åab·π≠):**  
   Narrators must have strong memory retention or precise written documentation to transmit the hadith exactly as received, without errors or forgetfulness. Imam Bukhari compared oral reports with written texts to ensure accuracy.  
   [Source: IIIT - Authentication of Hadith (PDF)](https://iiit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/books-in-brief_authentication_of_hadith.pdf)

4. **Freedom from Anomaly (Ghayr Shadz):**  
   The hadith must not contradict or deviate from more authentic hadith. A hadith is rejected if its text or chain conflicts with stronger narrations.  
   [Source: Genius Journals](https://geniusjournals.org/index.php/esh/article/download/1815/1620)

5. **Absence of Hidden Defects (‚ÄòIllah):**  
   There must be no hidden flaws or defects in the chain or the text that could undermine the hadith‚Äôs authenticity, even if these defects are subtle or not immediately apparent.  
   [Source: Islamic Journals PDF](https://www.islamicjournals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.1.7.pdf)

6. **Physical Meeting of Narrators:**  
   Imam Bukhari required evidence that narrators had actually met each other to transmit the hadith directly rather than through hearsay. Mere hearing of a report without meeting was insufficient.  
   [Source: Genius Journals](https://geniusjournals.org/index.php/esh/article/download/1815/1620)

7. **Consistency of Text (MuqƒÅranat al-Matn):**  
   When discrepancies arose between oral narration and written documentation, Imam Bukhari preferred the written text as being more reliable and authoritative. This helped him maintain textual authenticity.  
   [Source: Tharwah Journal](https://journal.iainlhokseumawe.ac.id/index.php/tharwah/article/download/583/1032/9796)

These stringent criteria revolutionized hadith authentication, establishing **Sahih al-Bukhari** as the most trusted hadith collection.

The five conditions that make a hadith **authentic (·π£a·∏•ƒ´·∏•)** each affect the ranking or classification of the hadith differently by ensuring different dimensions of reliability, authenticity, and acceptance in Islamic scholarship. These conditions were famously elaborated by Imam al-Bukhari and are foundational in hadith sciences.

Here is a detailed explanation of how each of the five conditions impacts hadith ranking or authenticity, based on original classical hadith science sources and scholarly studies:

### 1. **Continuity of the Chain (IttisƒÅl al-Sanad)**  
- This condition requires an *unbroken chain* of narrators from the last narrator back to the Prophet Ô∑∫. Each narrator must have directly heard from the previous one.  
- **Impact on hadith rank:** If the chain is broken (missing link or narrator), the hadith loses authenticity and is downgraded to weak (·∏ça‚Äòƒ´f), or in cases of multiple breaks, may be classified as *munqati‚Äò* (disconnected). A continuous chain is a top prerequisite for a hadith to be considered ·π£a·∏•ƒ´·∏• or ·∏•asan.  
- **Reference:** Imam Bukhari insisted on meeting and direct transmission as part of chain continuity.  
  [Tharwah Journal Study on Imam Bukhari‚Äôs Methodology](https://journal.iainlhokseumawe.ac.id/index.php/tharwah/article/download/583/1032/9796)

### 2. **Trustworthiness and Integrity of Narrators (‚ÄòAdƒÅlah)**  
- Each narrator must be upright, truthful, and practicing Islam properly‚Äîavoiding major sins and character flaws.  
- **Impact on hadith rank:** Narrators failing this condition cause the hadith to be considered weak or rejected if dishonesty or unreliability is proven. Trustworthy narrators are essential for hadith to be authentic.  
- **Reference:** Imam Bukhari's rigorous evaluation meant that only narrators meeting these criteria were accepted.  
  [Tharwah Journal - Imam Bukhari on Narrator Integrity](https://journal.iainlhokseumawe.ac.id/index.php/tharwah/article/download/583/1032/9796)

### 3. **Accuracy and Precision in Transmission (·∏åab·π≠)**  
- Narrators must have strong memory or accurate written records to transmit the hadith without error or forgetfulness.  
- **Impact on hadith rank:** Weak memory or mistakes in transmission cause hadith to be downgraded to ·∏•asan or ·∏ça‚Äòƒ´f, depending on severity. Precise transmission is key for a hadith to be ·π£a·∏•ƒ´·∏•.  
- **Reference:** Imam Bukhari sometimes compared oral reports with written versions and preferred the latter if discrepancies were found.  
  [IIIT - Authentication of Hadith (PDF)](https://iiit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/books-in-brief_authentication_of_hadith.pdf)

### 4. **Freedom from Anomaly (Ghayr Shadh)**  
- The hadith should not contradict or be anomalous compared to more authentic hadiths; it must align with the body of established narrations.  
- **Impact on hadith rank:** A hadith that is anomalous or contradictory to stronger traditions is rejected or classified weak despite meeting other conditions. This avoids accepting problematic or isolated reports.  
- **Reference:** Explained in various hadith authenticity studies emphasizing internal consistency.  
  [Genius Journals on Hadith Criticism](https://geniusjournals.org/index.php/esh/article/download/1815/1620)

### 5. **Absence of Hidden Defects (‚ÄòIllah)**  
- The hadith must be free of hidden textual or chain defects that may not be obvious but undermine authenticity. Such defects require advanced scrutiny from scholars.  
- **Impact on hadith rank:** Detection of a hidden defect leads to downgrading or rejection of the hadith. It ensures that hadith evaluation goes beyond surface checks.  
- **Reference:** Hadith sciences literature underscores this as crucial for ensuring reliability.  
  [Islamic Journals PDF on Hadith Authentication](https://www.islamicjournals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.1.7.pdf)

### Overview: How These Conditions Affect Hadith Ranking

| Condition                 | Effect on Hadith Classification                                                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Continuity of Chain        | Break leads to *Munqati‚Äò* (broken) or *Da‚Äòƒ´f* (weak); continuous chain required for *·π¢a·∏•ƒ´·∏•* or *·∏§asan* |
| Trustworthiness           | Untrustworthy narrators downgrade hadith to *·∏åa‚Äòƒ´f* or reject outright if severe           |
| Accuracy (Precision)      | Mistakes cause downgrade to *·∏§asan* or *·∏åa‚Äòƒ´f*                                            |
| Freedom from Anomaly      | Contradictions reject hadith or lower rank                                              |
| Absence of Hidden Defects | Hidden flaws lead to downgrade or rejection                                             |

When all five conditions are fully met, the hadith is classified as **·π¢a·∏•ƒ´·∏• (Authentic)**, considered the highest reliable type used for Islamic legal rulings, theology, and guidance.

If interested, Imam al-Bukhari's unique method also included **physical meeting of narrators** and **text comparison between oral and written**, further refining hadith reliability beyond these five core criteria.

Certain factors or minor irregularities in hadith transmission might not severely affect the overall authenticity or grade of the hadith, according to classical hadith science and scholars like Imam al-Bukhari. Here are such examples and explanations with references from authentic sources:

1. **Interchanging or Mixing of Names (Maqlub) or Minor Text Variations**  
   - Sometimes narrators mistakenly reverse names or slight parts of the text (such as word order or letters) without affecting the overall meaning. This is known as a *hadith maqloob*.  
   - Minor textual differences caused by similar sounding words (e.g., a difference in vowelization changing one word to another with close meaning) might be tolerable if the overall meaning remains intact. However, if the meaning changes significantly, this affects authenticity more strongly.  
   - Example: A hadith reported with slightly different wordings such as "it will distract you" vs "it will destroy you," caused by phonetic similarity, is considered a defect but might not invalidate authenticity if context supports the correct reading.  
   - [Source: Discussion of hidden defects in hadith - JIS Gambian Islamic Studies Journal PDF (p.3-4)](https://jis.iou.edu.gm/article/download/19/16/)

2. **Slight Weakness in Memory or Precision (·∏åab·π≠), but Narrators Still Trustworthy**  
   - Minor lapses in narrator memory or slight imprecision can downgrade a hadith from *·π£a·∏•ƒ´·∏•* (authentic) to *·∏•asan* (good), but the hadith remains reliable and acceptable in most cases.  
   - This factor has less effect if narrators are honest and upright, showing that perfect memorization is not always mandatory for acceptance at a certain level.  
   - [IIIT PDF on Hadith Authentication](https://iiit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/books-in-brief_authentication_of_hadith.pdf)  
   - [Tharwah Journal Study on Imam Bukhari‚Äôs Methodology](https://journal.iainlhokseumawe.ac.id/index.php/tharwah/article/download/583/1032/9796)

3. **Having a Single Narrator at One Point in the Chain (Gharƒ´b Status)**  
   - A hadith reported by only one narrator at some part of the chain is classified as *gharƒ´b* (rare/strange) but may still be *·π£a·∏•ƒ´·∏•* or *·∏•asan*. This rarity does not negate its authenticity but indicates limited transmission.  
   - This condition affects certainty but less so the validity if other reliability conditions are met.  
   - [Genius Journals on Hadith Authenticity](https://geniusjournals.org/index.php/esh/article/download/1815/1620)

4. **Slight Uncertainty About Physical Meeting of Narrators**  
   - Imam Bukhari especially emphasized physical meeting between narrators in the chain, but minor doubt or uncertainty here might be overlooked if narrators lived in the same era/location and other factors support the chain.  
   - This factor tends to cause suspicion unless corroborated by other strong chains.  
   - [IslamWeb Fatwa on Imam Bukhari‚Äôs Conditions](https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/86172/hadith-of-bukhari-and-muslim)

5. **Minor or Undiscovered Hidden Defects ( øIllah)**  
   - Hidden defects‚Äîsubtle textual or chain flaws not immediately obvious‚Äîmay exist but if they have not been discovered or are very minor, their effect on grading might be nominal until proven.  
   - Scholars continue to analyze hadith for such defects, but some hadith remain accepted pending any revealed flaws.  
   - [Islamic Journals PDF](https://www.islamicjournals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.1.7.pdf)

6. **Collation of Multiple Chains (Supporting Isnaads)**  
   - A weak or slightly flawed narration may be supported or strengthened by multiple other chains of narration (tawƒÅtur or multiple independent chains), thus improving its reliability despite some minor defects.  
   - This cumulative evidence can maintain hadith acceptance despite weaknesses in one chain.  
   - [Darul Tahqiq - Intricacies in Hadith Grading](https://www.darultahqiq.com/intricacies-in-hadith-grading/)

### Summary Table of Minor Issues with Limited Impact on Authenticity

| Minor Issue                      | Impact on Authenticity                             | Notes                                   |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Interchanged names/text (Maqlub) | Possible defect if meaning unchanged              | May not invalidate hadith                |
| Slight memory imprecision (·∏åab·π≠) | Downgrade from ·π£a·∏•ƒ´·∏• to ·∏•asan, still reliable    | Common minor imperfection                |
| Single narrator (Gharƒ´b)         | Affects rarity, not necessarily authenticity      | Less widely transmitted but valid       |
| Minor doubt on meeting narrators | Tolerated if narrators contemporaneous            | Needs corroboration                      |
| Hidden defects unknown/minor     | May have no current effect until discovered        | Under scholarly review                   |
| Multiple supporting chains       | Strengthens weak chain, maintains acceptance       | Collective reliability                   |

These types of minor defects or irregularities are acknowledged in hadith sciences as not automatically fatal to the hadith‚Äôs authenticity, especially when the core conditions‚Äîsuch as uprightness of narrators, general chain continuity, and absence of major contradictions‚Äîare firmly met.

If you want, I can find specific narrated hadith examples illustrating these minor defects or their mitigation in classification.

#### Hadith about intention

https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1

Here is the hadith chain diagram for the famous "Actions are judged by intentions" hadith, with a **neat double arrow style ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è** as you requested:

### _The following Hadith [from ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿ®ÿØÿ° ÿßŸÑŸàÿ≠Ÿâ ] uputil Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Ansari has only one narrator in Evey Version of this Hadith.
### Imam Bukhari out of 400 version of this only chose the following one. the reason is 
- that all the narrator are from the Land Of Wahi(Maka and Medina) not Sham etc.
- Prophet Mohammed pbuh said Give Qurish preference hence the presence of 'Al-Humaidi Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr' in here.


 **Prophet Muhammad Ô∑∫ ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è ‚ÄòUmar ibn al-Khattab ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è Alqamah ibn Waqqas ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Ansari**

### _classification of hadith._

The classification of hadith based on the *number of narrators* in the chain starts with **Mutawatir** and then progresses to levels with fewer narrators and hence lesser certainty. This scheme is distinct from the earlier discussion, which focused on narrator reliability or integrity.

**Main Levels of Hadith by Number of Narrators:**

- **Mutawatir (ŸÖÿ™Ÿàÿßÿ™ÿ±):**  
  Reported by such a large number of narrators in every generation of the chain that it is impossible for them to have colluded to fabricate it. Because of this mass transmission, *mutawatir* hadith provides certain knowledge and its authenticity is unquestionable. Denial of something established by a mutawatir hadith can be considered disbelief in mainstream Islamic theology.[1][2][3][5][6].

==Example== ;;;;;

*"Whoever tells a lie against me intentionally, then let him take his seat in Hellfire."*

**References:**
- Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 3, Hadith 106
- Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 76, Hadith 173
- Sahih Muslim, Book 1, Hadith 3[2][3]

This wording is consistent across the major hadith collections (*Sahih al-Bukhari* and *Sahih Muslim*), both of which are considered the most authentic books after the Qur'an.[5][6]

[7] http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari

- **Ahad (ÿ¢ÿ≠ÿßÿØ, Khabar Wahid):**  
  Reported by fewer people so that mass collusion is not impossible; provides only probabilistic knowledge. *Ahad* is further subdivided:[3][5][1]
  
  - **Mashhur (ŸÖÿ¥ŸáŸàÿ±, Famous):**  
    Narrated by three or more people in every generation but not enough for mutawatir status.[5]
  
  - **Aziz (ÿπÿ≤Ÿäÿ≤, Strong):**  
    Narrated by at least two reporters in every generation of the chain.[5]
  
  - **Gharib (ÿ∫ÿ±Ÿäÿ®, Strange):**  
    Narrated by only one reporter at some point in the chain.[5]

| Hadith Type | Definition | Number of Narrators |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Mutawatir**  | Mass transmitted, impossible to forge | Very large group, every generation |
| **Mashhur**    | Famous, common knowledge | Three or more, every generation |
| **Aziz**       | Strong, rare but supported by two | Two, every generation |
| **Gharib**     | Strange, single transmission | Only one, at any stage |

**Supporting Details and Application:**
- *Mutawatir* is very rare; most hadith fall into the *ahad* category (including mashhur, aziz, gharib).[3]
- Only *mutawatir* provides certainty; *ahad* (and its subtypes) provide probabilistic authenticity and may be subject to further scrutiny.[3][5]
- The reliability and acceptability of hadith for establishing beliefs or legal rulings is strongly tied to this classification.[2]
- Within *Ahad*, the gradation (Mashhur, Aziz, Gharib) is determined by counting narrators at each level in the isnad (chain of transmission).[5]

This is the classification system that begins with **Mutawatir** and proceeds to graded levels based on the number of people reporting the narration.[6][1][5]

The term **"Ashab al-Sunan"** can be understood as those early narrators prominently featured in the **Sunan** collections like Sunan Abu Dawud, Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Sunan al-Nasa'i, Sunan Ibn Majah, and others, often including prominent companions and early followers who actively narrated legal and practical traditions of the Prophet.

Regarding your second query which seems to be "Arba‚Äô Rawhu al-Arba‚Äô" or similar (likely **Arba' Rawaat al-Arba‚Äô** or **Arba‚Äô Ruwat al-Arba‚Äô**), this refers to the grouping often titled:

- **"The Four Narrators" (Arba‚Äô Rawaat)** or
- **"The Four Great Narrators"**


In summary:

| Term                 | Meaning                                           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Ashab al-Sunan**   | Early narrators, companions and followers, whose hadith were collected in the major Sunan books |
| **Arba‚Äô Rawaat al-Arba‚Äô** | The four major narrators or transmitters of hadith from Tabi‚Äòun generation, core to hadith preservation |

If you want, I can provide more detailed names or elaboration based on classical hadith science or specific texts. Let me know!

When someone refers to the **7 books of hadith**, they generally mean a set of highly respected hadith collections that extend beyond the famous six canonical Sunni collections known as the *Kutub al-Sittah*. The term for these 7 books isn't standardized universally, but often when the 7 books are mentioned, it includes the traditional six plus one additional important work such as *Muwatta Imam Malik* or another major collection.

Similarly, the **9 books of hadith** refer to an expanded group that includes:

- The six canonical books (*Kutub al-Sittah*):  
  1. Sahih al-Bukhari  
  2. Sahih Muslim  
  3. Sunan al-Nasa'i  
  4. Sunan Abi Dawud  
  5. Sunan al-Tirmidhi  
  6. Sunan Ibn Majah  

- Plus three additional significant collections such as:  
  7. Muwatta Imam Malik  
  8. Sunan ad-Darimi  
  9. Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal

These nine books are often referenced in scholarly indexing like the hadith concordance *Al-Mu‚Äôjamul Mufahras li Alfadhil Hadithin Nabawi* and represent a very comprehensive range of hadith literature that covers a broad spectrum of narrations and topics.

### Summary Table:

| Number of Books | What They Are Called      | Main Books Included                                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **6 books**     | *Kutub al-Sittah* (Six Canonical Books) | Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan an-Nasa'i, Sunan Abi Dawud, Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Sunan Ibn Majah |
| **7 books**     | Sometimes *Seven Books* or a variant | The six above plus Muwatta Malik or another collection like Musnad Ahmad     |
| **9 books**     | Commonly just "Nine Books of Hadith" | The six canonical plus Muwatta Malik, Sunan ad-Darimi, Musnad Ahmad           |

So when you hear references to the "7 books" or "9 books" of hadith, they're describing extended canonical groupings of hadith collections beyond the core six, including some of the earliest and most comprehensive hadith works^.[1][2][3]

If you want, I can provide details on the significance or contents of any of these collections as well.

Among the nine major hadith collections, **Imam al-Bukhari**, the compiler of *Sahih al-Bukhari*, recorded the most hadith narrations. His collection contains approximately **7,563 hadith narrations (including repetitions)** and is considered the most extensive and most authentic among the canonical books.[1][3]

In comparison, for example, **Imam al-Tirmidhi's** *Jami‚Äô al-Tirmidhi* contains roughly **4,400 hadiths** (including repetitions), which is less than half the size of *Sahih al-Bukhari*.[2][3]

To summarize:

| Compiler          | Collection(s)                                 | Approximate Number of Hadiths       |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Imam al-Bukhari   | Sahih al-Bukhari                             | ~7,563                             |
| Imam Muslim       | Sahih Muslim                                 | Fewer than Bukhari, but highly authentic (exact figures vary) |
| Abu Dawud         | Sunan Abi Dawud                              | Several thousand                   |
| Al-Tirmidhi       | Jami‚Äô al-Tirmidhi                            | ~4,400                            |
| An-Nasa'i         | Sunan An-Nasa'i                             | Several thousand                   |
| Ibn Majah         | Sunan Ibn Majah                             | Several thousand                   |
| Malik ibn Anas     | Muwatta Imam Malik                            | Thousands but fewer than Bukhari  |
| Al-Darimi         | Sunan ad-Darimi                              | Thousands                         |
| Ahmad ibn Hanbal   | Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal                       | About 27,000 (including repetitions) but organized differently  |

Note: Though *Musnad Ahmad* compiled by Ahmad ibn Hanbal is very large in terms of raw hadith count (around 27,000), it includes many repetitions and narrations collected by many narrators without strict filtration, unlike *Sahih al-Bukhari*, which has strict authenticity criteria.

Therefore, in terms of curated authentic hadith in the context of the canonical nine books, **Imam al-Bukhari recorded the most hadith with rigorous authentication standards**.[3][1][2]

If you want, I can also provide counts or detailed comparisons for the other collections.

benefits of intention;
lets say two person just donne wudu and pray 2 rakat, but one gets 3 times more rewards with right intention.
1- prayer of fresh/new wudu
2- majid entering pray
3- sunnah if its the right time for it.
