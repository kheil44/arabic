## 📚 Categories of Hadith

In Islamic tradition, hadith (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) are classified into several categories based on their authenticity and reliability. Here are the seven main categories:

### 1. **Sahih (صحيح)**
   - **Definition**: Authentic hadith that is well-established and reliable.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Continuous chain of trustworthy narrators.
     - Free from any hidden defects.
     - Conforms to the principles of Islamic teachings.

### 2. **Hasan (حسن)**
   - **Definition**: Good hadith that is slightly less reliable than sahih but still acceptable.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Chain of narrators is reliable but may have minor issues.
     - Generally accepted for use in Islamic teachings.

### 3. **Sahih li Ghayrihi (صحيح لغيره)**
   - **Definition**: A hadith that is considered sahih due to supporting evidence from other sources.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Not originally sahih on its own but gains authenticity through corroborating hadith.

### 4. **Gharib (غريب)**
   - **Definition**: A hadith that has a weak chain of narrators or is reported by a single narrator.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - May be accepted if it does not contradict stronger hadith.

### 5. **Da'if (ضعيف)**
   - **Definition**: Weak hadith that lacks reliability.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Contains issues in the chain of narrators or the content itself.
     - Generally not used for establishing legal rulings.

### 6. **Da'if Jidan (ضعيف جداً)**
   - **Definition**: Very weak hadith with significant issues in its chain or content.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Not acceptable for use in any serious context.

### 7. **Mawdu' (موضوع)**
   - **Definition**: Fabricated hadith that is falsely attributed to the Prophet Muhammad.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Completely unreliable and rejected in Islamic teachings.

These categories help scholars and students of hadith determine the reliability and applicability of various narrations in Islamic jurisprudence and teachings. Understanding these classifications is essential for anyone studying hadith literature.







The five conditions that make a hadith **authentic (sahih)** are well-established in Islamic scholarship. Briefly, they are:

1. **Continuity of the Chain (Ittisaal as-Sanad):**  
   Each narrator in the chain must have directly heard or received the narration from the previous one, ensuring an unbroken, connected chain back to the Prophet ﷺ.
   =sahaba -> tabeen -> atba tabeen. [at leas one narrator from each generation to keep the chain connected. ]

3. **Integrity of the Narrators (‘Adaalah):**  
   Every narrator must be of upright character — a truthful, practicing Muslim who avoids major sins and is trustworthy.
   => not known for openely commit sin, not known for commity any form of heresy. _marowa_ i guess, meaning kept conduct that was acceptable.
4. **Accuracy/Precision of Transmission (Dabt):**  
   Narrators must have strong memory and attention to detail, accurately preserving and conveying the hadith without errors or forgetfulness.
   => should be able to narrate the hadith Exactly as Heard.

6. **Freedom from Anomaly (Ghayr Shadh):**  
   The hadith must not contradict or conflict with other more reliable or well-known narrations; it should be consistent with established reports.
   The hadith must not contradict, Quran, another narrator.

8. **Absence of Hidden Defects (‘Illah Qadiha):**  
   The hadith must be free of hidden flaws or defects in the chain or text that might undermine its authenticity, even if not immediately obvious.

When a hadith meets all these five criteria, scholars classify it as **sahih (authentic)** and consider it reliable to source Islamic rulings and beliefs.[1][2][3][4][7]

## 🌟 Seven Types of People Who Will Be Shaded by Allah

In Islamic tradition, there are specific categories of individuals who will receive special shade from Allah on the Day of Judgment. This shade is a sign of Allah's mercy and protection. Here are the seven categories:

### 1. **A Just Ruler**
   - A leader who governs with fairness and justice, ensuring that their subjects are treated equitably.

### 2. **A Young Person Who Grows Up in Worship**
   - A person who dedicates their youth to the worship of Allah and follows His guidance throughout their life.

### 3. **A Person Whose Heart is Attached to the Mosque**
   - Someone who regularly attends the mosque for prayers and feels a deep connection to it, finding peace and solace in worship.

### 4. **Two People Who Love Each Other for the Sake of Allah**
   - Friends or companions who come together and maintain their relationship solely for the love of Allah, without any ulterior motives.

### 5. **A Person Who Gives Charity in Secret**
   - An individual who gives to those in need without seeking recognition or praise, ensuring their acts of charity remain private.

### 6. **A Person Who is Tempted by a Beautiful Woman but Resists**
   - Someone who is approached with temptation but chooses to remain steadfast and resist, fearing Allah.
 bu
### 7. **A Person Who Remembers Allah in Solitude**
   - An individual who engages in the remembrance of Allah when alone, feeling a deep connection and devotion in their private moments.
for example; Narrated by Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:
"The left hand does not know what the right hand has given in charity."

but some mention  that "...... the Left hand has given in charity." things like this make it Defective. not the whole hadith but this point can make it alright that you can give charit with Left hand....."
